      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-week-1&#34;&gt;My week. 1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October started. You can see how i designed my bullet journal for this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a mulled wine recipe to help you survive autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MULLED WINE INGREDIENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, gather your ingredients. For this mulled wine recipe, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wine: No need to splurge on a pricey bottle — a mid-range bottle of dry red or white wine will do. (Or if you’re making a big batch, this is a great recipe to break out a nicer boxed wine too!) The best wine for mulled wine will be fruity and full-bodied, so that it can withstand the heat and not have its flavor completely drowned out by the aromatics. I recommend looking for a bottle of Zinfandel, Merlot, Grenache,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandy: Similar to sangria, it’s also traditional to spike your mulled wine with an extra bit of liqueur. Brandy is the traditional choice, but Cointreau (or another orange liqueur) or tawny port are also delicious alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh oranges: One of which we will slice and mull in the wine, one of which you can slice and use as a garnish if you’d like. (Edit: To minimize bitterness, I recommend peeling the orange before simmering it in the wine.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon: I love the making mulled wine with cinnamon sticks, but you could whisk in some ground cinnamon if that’s what you have on hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mulling spices: These vary in mulled wine from country to country, but whole cloves and star anise are my favorites, plus perhaps a few cardamom pods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweetener: Feel free to add your favorite sweetener to taste. Sugar is classic, but I prefer to naturally sweeten mine with either maple syrup or honey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO MAKE MULLED WINE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make mulled wine, simply…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine ingredients. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and give them a quick stir.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simmer. Heat until the wine almost reaches a simmer over medium-high heat. (Avoid letting it bubble in any way. Alcohol begins to vaporize at 172°F, so take care to ensure that the wine does not evaporate.)  Reduce heat to low, cover completely, and let the wine simmer for at least 15 minutes or up to 3 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strain and season. Using a fine mesh strainer, remove and discard the orange slices, cloves, cinnamon sticks, star anise and ginger. Give the mulled wine a taste, and stir in your desired amount of extra sweetener if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve. Serve warm in heatproof mugs, topped with your favorite garnishes.
Full ingredient amounts/instructions listed in the recipe below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSSIBLE VARIATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to customize this mulled wine a bit? Feel free to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use white wine: This recipe is also delicious (and lovely) when made with a dry white wine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a chai tea bag: In place of the cloves and star anise, feel free to steep 1 or 2 chai tea bags in the mulled wine (preferably caffeine-free, if you are serving this to a group in the evening).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add different aromatics: Feel free to add in whatever aromatics sound fun! Fresh ginger slices, cardamom pods, nutmeg, allspice or lemon zest are some other great aromatics to try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add garnishes: For a festive touch, feel free to sprinkle some fresh cranberries in the pot a few minutes before serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Crock Pot mulled wine: You are also welcome to try making mulled wine in the slow cooker with the setting on low. I just want to clearly caution that slow cookers can run the gamut when it comes to what they consider a “low” temperature. So if you use a slow cooker, be sure to keep a very close eye on it to ensure that the wine is not accidentally overheated and simmering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Version Control System. Git.</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;version-control-system-git&#34;&gt;Version Control System. Git.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version Control Systems (VCS) are used when several people work on one project. Typically, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows you to record them, combine changes made by different project participants, and roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic version control systems use a centralized model, which involves a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a dedicated server. Before starting work, a project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs using certain commands. After making changes, the user posts the new version to the repository. However, previous versions are not deleted from the central storage and can be returned to at any time. The server can not save the full version of the changed files, but perform so-called delta compression - saving only changes between successive versions, which allows reducing the amount of stored data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when multiple people are working on the same file. You can combine (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, discard changes altogether, or lock files for change. Depending on the settings, the lock prevents other users from obtaining a working copy or prevents the working copy of the file from being modified by the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support multiple versions of a single file, maintaining a shared history of changes up to the point of a version branch and each branch&amp;rsquo;s own history of changes. In addition, information is usually available about which participants made what changes, when, and what changes. Typically this type of information is stored in a change log, access to which can be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike classic ones, in distributed version control systems a central repository is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their operation are similar; they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in their work.&lt;/p&gt;
